## Context

In this chapter you'll find the scene of this project. Here we start with explaining what the software is all about, and what it is we are building.

Thereafter we explain how this project will fit in the existing environment. And last but not least we describe who are using this software.

### What this project is about

In this project an assignment is being realized for the course DWA (development web applications).

The project team consists of five students. Who work together on a software tool.

### What it is that's being built

In this project we develop a software tool that supports teachers by tracking the progress of their pupils.

The intention is that pupils keep a digital log, in this log they indicate for each learning objective wheter this is clear or not.

Based on the logs of pupils teachers can provide support.

### How this software fits into it's current environment

In the current environment they already make use of logs. Only at the moment these are paper logs.

The principle remains the same. only the environment undergoes a digital transformation.
